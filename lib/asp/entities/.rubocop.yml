# in the ASP entities building code (i.e this folder) we make a lot of
# calls to the same XML builder objet (`xml.tag(content)`), which
# offends Rubocop because it looks like high ABC complexity. Minimise
# the drama by allowing repeated attributes which means a bunch of
# calls to the same `xml` object are not accumulated and greatly
# reduces the initial offense count.
